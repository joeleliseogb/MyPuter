# Puter Git Client

This is a JavaScript in-browser git client running on the Puter filesystem, using [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org).

It aims to match `git`'s interface, so that running a command behaves the same way as it would there.
Of course, `git` has a large variety of subcommands and options, some of which are obscure, so many will be missing.
Consider adding them if you are interested! :^)

While this is built for Puter, the only Puter-specific parts are:
- `src/filesystem.js` which integrates with Puter's filesystem.
- `src/main.js` which uses the Puter SDK to connect to the parent Phoenix shell.

By modifying these, and the values in `config/`, you should be able to port it to other environments.

## Subcommand structure

The `git` CLI is structured as a series of sub-commands - `git branch` has nothing in common with `git version`, for example. Each of these is modelled as its own file in `src/subcommands`, and should export a default object with the following structure:

```js
export default {
    // The subcommand's name
    name: 'help',
    // A string or array of strings, for how the subcommand is run. Shown in the help.
    usage: [
        'git help [-a|--all]',
        'git help <command>',
    ],
    // A description, shown in the help.
    description: `Display help information for git itself, or a subcommand.`,
    // Arguments object, passed to `parseArgs()`
    args: {
        allowPositionals: true,
        options: {
            all: {
                // The one deviation from parseArgs() is that each option gets a description,
                // which is shown in the help output.
                description: 'List all available subcommands.',
                type: 'boolean',
            }
        },
    },
    // Function to actually run the subcommand.
    // The return value can be a posix-style exit code, or a plain `return` as a shorthand for 0.
    // Throwing errors is allowed.
    // Throwing the special `SHOW_USAGE` value defined in `src/help.js` can be used to print the command usage text.
    execute: async (ctx) => {
        // ctx has the following structure:
        ctx = {
            io: {
                stdout, // Function that takes a string, and prints it to stdout
                stderr, // Function that takes a string, and prints it to stderr
            },
            fs,   // A filesystem implementation, for isomorphic-git
            args, // An object returned from `parseArgs()`.
            env,  // Object containing environment variables, such as PWD for the current working directory.
        }
    }
}
```
These are them listed in `src/subcommands/__exports__.js`, which can be automatically generated by running `packages/phoenix/tools/gen.js packages/git/src/subcommands` from the Puter repo root. But it's not hard to modify manually.

## Common patterns

### Shared options

It's common in a few places that options are shared between commands, for example options related to formatting commits are shared by `git log` and `git show`.
In these cases, those options are defined in an object in `src/format.js` with an accompanying function to process their results into a more convenient format.
For example, `diff_formatting_options` and `process_diff_formatting_options(options)`:
Some of the options are shorthands for others; some "imply" another; and some are set by default under certain conditions.
All this is handled in one place instead of in each subcommand that needs them.

### Repo root

Since the `git` command may be run from a repository, a subdirectory, or a non-repository, you can locate the git directory like so:
```js
const { dir, gitdir } = await find_repo_root(fs, env.PWD);
```
The `dir` and `gitdir` variables can then be passed to isomorphic-git methods that expect them.
If no repository is found, this will throw an error, which is then printed to stderr.
(isomorphic-git's `git.findRoot()` does not implement checks for a `.git` text file that points to an alternative directory that git's metadata is stored in. We should maybe upstream this.)
